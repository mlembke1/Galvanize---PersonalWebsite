# Galvanize---PersonalWebsite
2 - 3 page website about me using HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery

Had a lot of fun building this! I have wanted to include a video background for a long time now. 
I think they are super awesome and can used in great ways. However, as this was my first time using one, 
I have had some trouble making it responsive to the mobile and tablet screen sizes. But, even with that 
problem, I am still happy that I got it to work in the desktop view! Hope you guys enjoy! 

All the best, 
Mitch Lembke
